# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
I am most proud of the final question (5) in the final_practice.rb . I created a method that will take in the number of stock and the name of that stock as arguments, and the method definition will run a conditional check and puts a response based the value of the number of stock. I felt that composing this conditional statement in such a way that the strings are static, but the statements that have the arguments checked vary based on the passed first argument, streamlined this method, consolidating the methods definition to only 6 lines of code.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
methods are like machines that take in arguments and spit out a result in the methods global memory. It helps computate inputs outside of the global memory and removing the need for redundant variable names, and memory utilization on the global side during interpretation.
